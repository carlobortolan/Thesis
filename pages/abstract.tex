Video streaming platforms are used on a daily basis by millions of users and need to be able to provide high-quality videos without interruptions. \href{https://tum.live}{TUM-Live}\footnote{\url{https://tum.live}}, used daily by thousands of students at the \ac{TUM} is a perfect example for such a system that consists of multiple services that need to perform reliably with as little human intervention as possible.
In my bachelor's thesis, I researched different approaches to scaling such a system and increasing stability by extending the current TUM-Live infrastructure to a distributed network managed by different organizations that can share computing resources and storage. Additionally, I analyzed different API\footnote{\ac{API}} design approaches by comparing the current REST\footnote{\ac{REST}} \ac{API} with a prototype for a gRPC\footnote{\ac{gRPC}} \ac{API} that reduced latency by 3x and improved throughput by 8x. The overall goal was to understand, analyze and improve the current infrastructure and assess its potential to scale and identify potential future limitations, such as performance bottlenecks within the subsystems or the problem of having an in-memory chat system.
