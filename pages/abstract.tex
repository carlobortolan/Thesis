TODO: Update

Video streaming platforms are used on a daily basis by millions of users and need to be able to provide high-quality videos without interruptions. TUM-Live, used daily by more than 15.000 students at TUM is a perfect example for such a system that consists of multiple services that need to perform reliably with as little human intervention as possible.
In my Bachelor Thesis, I would research different approaches to scaling such a system and increasing stability by optimizing the TUM-Live workers and connected APIs. The goal is to understand, analyze and improve the current infrastructure, as well as assess its potential to scale and identify any potential future limitations.
How can the existing infrastructure behind video streaming services such as TUM-Live be optimized and scaled while maintaining reliability, stability and high streaming quality?
